## üõ≥Ô∏è Shipping Calculator

A Python script to calculate shipping prices according to weight. Type the weight in lbs and the system will print the calculated prices based on dummy information set for Ground, Ground Premium, and Drone shipping methods.

## üìù Learnings

- Data types (`float`): Accepts integer input with decimals.
- Loops (`while`): Keeps the script going with guided inputs e.g. 'quit', 'start' or float input.
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`): Checks if the input satisfies the stated conditions and run the script accordingly.
- Python's `try... except ValueError` is similar to JavaScript's `try... catch(error)` which I am familiar with.
- Python's `locale` library: Specifies how numbers should be formatted e.g. two decimal places, with thousands separators.

## üíª Try It Out

Download the `shipping.py` file and open it in a Python program e.g. IDLE, or on VS Code and run `python3 shipping.py`. Run the script and test it out!
